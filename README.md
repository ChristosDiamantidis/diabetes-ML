# diabetes-ML
A machine learning, logistic regression model for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. 
Database made available from the National Institute of Diabetes.

Two versions of the model are available:

Model_1 includes all possible diagnostic predictors available on the dataset. Theoretically suitable for in-hospital use.
Model_2 includes only diagnostic predictors available in a home setting, for e-health application. 

A Model_2 with high recall (>0.9) and acceptable specificity could alleviate unnecessary primary care visits and testing costs for non-diabetic subjects.
